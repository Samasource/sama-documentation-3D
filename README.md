In this repository, we focus on organizing and maintaining the React and Bootstrap content that is utilized within our HelpJuice platform. By centralizing these resources, we ensure consistency, efficiency, and ease of access for our team and users.

Here are some key aspects of this repository:

1. React DOM Integration: We utilize React DOM to seamlessly incorporate our custom components into HelpJuice without relying on iframes. This approach ensures compatibility with HelpJuice styles and minimizes potential issues that could arise from future updates.

2. Bootstrap Integration: To maintain a consistent design language across our HelpJuice platform, we integrate Bootstrap frameworks and styles. By leveraging Bootstrap's comprehensive library of UI elements and responsive layouts, we enhance the visual coherence and user experience of our platform.

This is only used in specific sections of the documentation where we want to more interactive documentation.
We are importing our own version of react and bootstrap so we avoid version problems.
